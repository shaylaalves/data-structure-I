## Welcome to My Programming Journey! ðŸŒŸ

I'm excited to share my progress as I tackle exercises from beecrowd and my Computer Science coursework. Currently, I'm learning Pascal to apply it in my Data Structures class and Python as the primary language for my Discrete Mathematics exercises. Every challenge is a step forward in mastering the art of coding.
Feel free to explore, contribute, and improve your programming skills. Happy coding! ðŸš€
